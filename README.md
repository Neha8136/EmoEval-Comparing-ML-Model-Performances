# EmoEval: Comparing ML Model Performances
                                   Introduction Of EEG
This project develops an Electroencephalogram (EEG) Emotion Extractor, a system for detecting and interpreting human emotions from EEG signals. Using state-of-the-art EEG devices, brainwave data is recorded and processed with advanced signal processing techniques. Feature extraction methods identify patterns linked to emotional states.

Machine learning algorithms like support vector machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classify emotions such as positive, negative and neutral. Performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The project also integrates real-time emotion detection into applications for adaptive learning, mental health therapy, and responsive gaming. Ethical considerations regarding user privacy and data security are addressed.

In summary, the EEG Emotion Extractor demonstrates the potential of using EEG signals for emotion recognition, enhancing human-computer interactions and emotional well-being through innovative technology.
